# SwapLife

SwapLife is a mobile application that lets users experience daily routines based on different MBTI personality types. By "swapping lives" with friends for a day, users can explore how their behavior or mood might shift when living like a different MBTI — encouraging self-reflection, empathy, and new perspectives on identity.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Create and customize your MBTI-based daily checklist
- Swap checklists with friends to experience their routines
- Analyze how your MBTI may change based on swapped behaviors
- Real-time syncing and data sharing through Firebase
- Simple and intuitive UI designed with Figma

## 💡 Motivation
MBTI is often used to define one's identity, but test results can vary depending on context. SwapLife addresses this by giving users the opportunity to *live out* different MBTI routines instead of just imagining them — breaking away from monotonous routines and encouraging fresh emotional insights.
